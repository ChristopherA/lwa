  	      #SmartCustody is all about figuring out what protects your personal assets best. Many might see an institution as being a strong protector, whether it be an exchange, a bank, or a lawyer. But you have to assess the gains against the dangers for your personal situation. (2/8)

  	      Our examples of this are mostly theoretical, as companies don't like to publicize actual thefts of this sort. But an engineer could backdoor a system, a bank employee could physically steal something from a safety deposit box. (3/8)

  	      Certainly there are protections against this sort of thing, often quite robust protections. For example, fiduciary responsiblity requires dual control to theoretically keep any single employee from engaging in theft. (4/8)

  	      How do you address this adversary? KYI! Know Your Institution. Be aware of its history and (politely) ask questions about how it addresses questions of personal responsibility.  Ask your peers — recommendations can be pretty important too. (6/8)

  	      As always when using these adversaries in a process to improve management of your own risks, the trick is to think of only adversary’s motive  at a time. Don't become overwhelmed by addressing all forms of theft at once. (7/8)
