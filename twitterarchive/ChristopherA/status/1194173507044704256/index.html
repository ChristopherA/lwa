  	      I'm a bit confused as the @Nitrokey spec only of the stm32f103r8 chip, which doesn't seem to be a tamper-resistant chip and thus not truly an HSM. Am I missing something? <a href="https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f103r8.pdf">https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f103r8.pdf</a>
