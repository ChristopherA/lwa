  	      The thing is: you can't really avoid this. If you're living in a society, you agreeing to abide by its rules. If you try and keep your funds from legal acquisition, then you could be thrust from that society. (3/8)

  	      The problem of course arises if your state has corrupt motives. (Or if some other person manipulates the legal system for corrupt motives of their own.) And again, defending against this is difficult. (4/8)

  	      LEGAL FORFEITURE isn’t always obvious. California in 2007 seized bank safe-deposit boxes improperly. Currency, monetary instruments &amp; physical good were sold, taxed, and held in trust, but all other paper was destroyed. There goes your paper wallet! <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/print?id=4832471">https://abcnews.go.com/print?id=4832471</a> (5/8)

  	      This is why in our best practices shared in our #SmartCustody you check up on your bank safe-deposit boxes every six months! We recommend spring around April 15th (tax day), and in autumn around November 1st (day of the dead). (6/8)

  	      As with several adversaries discussed in #SmartCustody, one of the best solutions is to not make yourself a target by hiding the depth of your digital holdings. Another is to legally tangle your assets—in upcoming v2 book we'll talk about using multisig fiduciaries to help. (7/8)
