  	      The concern is understandable. The beliefs of centralized government and those of advocates of decentralized services can run straight against each other. (2/8)

  	      This hasn't been helped by some governments' prejudicial attitudes toward cryptocurrency in the early years of Bitcoin, and waffling support back &amp; forth today. (3/8)

  	      But that's not necessarily the state of things today, and that's what #SmartCustody is all about: approaching potential adversaries without emotion, seeing what they want, and assessing whether that's a danger to your own holdings. (5/8)

  	      So you have to ask: am I in a state likely to take my holdings by illegal means? Am I in danger of losing my holdings to legal means? Would it be just if that happened? The answers to those questions helps to define the danger of these adversaries. (6/8)
