  	      Very frustrated today finding &amp; using @CreativeCommons images for some hobby game designs. Image search (Google, etc.) that supposedly support search for CC are doing an increasingly poor job of dealing with ripoff sites, such as Pixabay lists lots of stuff as CC that are not. /1

  	      I've had to go back to a number of images I'd planned to use and do due diligence on them. Best tool for that so far has been @tineye which does reverse image search. It can list oldest found similar images, and that is where I often find the real creators &amp; typically non-CC /2
