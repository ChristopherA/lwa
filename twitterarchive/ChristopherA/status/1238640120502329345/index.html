  	      #Argentina is banning flights from US next week due to #covid, but in many cases this means that that flights TO Argentina are being cancelled. Last day to leave is Monday else 30+ days. Now waiting for @AmericanAir to officially cancel so we get can get booked on new flight!ðŸ˜¡

  	      Since there has been no evidence of community spread here in #Argentina yet, we had thought weâ€™d finish our full trip here. Social distancing measures have begunâ€”museums, sports, etc. But my planning scenarios did not include that Argentina would be the one to block travel to US.
