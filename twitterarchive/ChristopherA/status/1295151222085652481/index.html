  	      @mflaxman In the pure Shamir scenario that would be 4 of 9 (i.e. 4:[abcdefghi]) and all a group (say business partners) needs to do is bribe one person in another interest (a friend or one family). In two-layer, they have to get two from at least 2 sets of different interests.

  	      @mflaxman There are some other advantages I like to 4 of 9, including some good ideas on progressive UX and a second backup. Add in some timelock and OR bitcoin script tricks, you can make quite a solid recovery strategy.
