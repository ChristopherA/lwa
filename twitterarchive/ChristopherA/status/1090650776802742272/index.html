  	      We plan to repeat this initial workshop a couple times to improve it &amp; then offer videos, workbooks, etc. online. Then we move forward on the next step of improving the digital asset custody practices of hedge &amp; family funds, fiduciaries, etc. as well as educate regulators.

  	      We hope that by educating &amp; raising the bar on custody practices that we can mitigate a huge systemic risk that I see to our system if current practices &amp; custodial “security theater” continue. Subscribe <a href="https://tinyletter.com/SmartCustody">https://tinyletter.com/SmartCustody</a> or follow @SmartCustody as we iterate &amp; improve!
