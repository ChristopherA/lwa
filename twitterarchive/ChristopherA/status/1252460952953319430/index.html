  	      My best guess that the idea was that by using m/48' for multisig paths, you'd never need to check a single signature bitcoin address for balance from those derived keys, and you'l never reuse a derived key that will be used for a single-signature wallet and also multisig wallet.

  	      I've started a HackMD markdown document with my notes for now, but with the goal of a BIP quality document to submit either a future BIP or SLIP document in the future. DM me if you want added for access, but I'll make a GitHub repo for it soon.
