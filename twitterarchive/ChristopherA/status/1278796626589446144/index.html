  	      #SmartCustody is about making risks concrete through their anthropomorphization as adversaries and using that insight to determine if the risks affect you. I don't think most people are likely to have their digital assets taken by a nation-state. (5/13)

  	      Because the bottom line is, as our motivation suggests, a nation-state can do a lot worse to you than seize digital assets if it wants, and probably do much more easily than focus on seizing your digital assets. (6/13)

  	      This distinction become blurry when when talk about non-nation-state governments actors, such as regions and cities. For instance, I gave the example of California seizing safety deposit boxes that were unused (by a very flaky definition of "unused"). (10/13)
