  	      I have great sympathy for both sides of the problem that @hackerfactor brings up in this post about the @torproject. He is correct these should be fixed, but doesn‚Äôt understand their financial limitations. He wants to report bugs but not fix. They don‚Äôt have $ to fix. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <a href="https://twitter.com/hackerfactor/status/1286316046618488832">https://twitter.com/hackerfactor/status/1286316046618488832</a>

  	      I‚Äôm in the same boat with my leadership in @BlockchainComns. You can‚Äôt tell volunteers what to do, and you have very limited funds for professional secure software development so you have to prioritize. Thus there holes between that are hard to fill. We are seeking to solve this.
