  	      @hackerfactor @torproject @BlockchainComns Remember, you said in your blog that you didn't have time to learn how to be part of the community to be able to contribute the fix yourself. Community costs management time and resources too. And I find I am peter-principled keeping money flowing too, so some costs there.

  	      @hackerfactor @torproject @BlockchainComns There is also a matter of priorities — who knows if there is some other project in the works that totally replaces that code? Again, I have no idea of the internals, and yes, $3-$4M a year would be a great budget to have, but don't call it easy. …

  	      @hackerfactor @torproject @BlockchainComns To your side of the equation I think their response has been far too long, and as an active user and supporter of Tor I need them to be more secure. And as the co-author of SSL/TLS, things like Heartbleed (also a money problem) worry me.

  	      @hackerfactor @torproject @BlockchainComns Worse, Tor just lost their best revenue sources, the OTF. This doesn't excuse long delays to fix old vulnerability reports, but it does mean that they are probably devoting as much time to new issues as they should be.

  	      @hackerfactor @torproject @BlockchainComns Part of why I founded @BlockchainComns is to look deeper at the root of these problems while we also practice what we preach and deliver on our advocacy. No easy answers, but we are understanding the problem better. (fini)
