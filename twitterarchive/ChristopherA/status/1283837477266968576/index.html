  	      Fungibility means that any one unit of a currency is indistinguishable from any other unit. All dollar bills are mostly fungible: until someone writes down a serial number and then monitors its use. The same is true with digital assets. (2/15)

  	      In fact, cryptocurrency like Bitcoin should be even more fungible than most paper currency. That's because it's constantly being pooled. There's no such thing as a discrete coin in Bitcoin — instead all Bitcoin is only a balances on an accounts in a ledger. (3/15)

  	      Yesterday's #TwitterHack netted over $110K of Bitcoin but already those coins are being blacklisted. Seems like a paltry amount given the sophistication of the attack—but what if the attacker gave those coins to thousands of innocent people? All funds could be blacklisted. (7/15)

  	      But it isn't all about illegal source of funds. In the US cryptocurrencies are not legally a "currency” but instead are an "intangible property”. This means that a bankruptcy court could legally say “that payment to you was pledged to someone else, give it back". (8/15)

  	      Mitigating the risks of the LOSS OF FUNGIBILITY adversary are difficult. First step is to make sure that exchanges don't have exclusive control of your private keys. As I wrote a few days ago, true Censorship is hard because when we are using a decentralized system. (9/15)

  	      If you in the US are planning to pledge your cryptocurrency against a loan, consider holding your cryptocurrency in Wyoming. Under their laws, after two years all of those funds are consider "perfected" and can't be clawed back by a bankruptcy judge.
