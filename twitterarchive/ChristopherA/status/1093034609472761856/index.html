  	      I have believed that this is a critical problem in the computer game industry for awhile, yet somehow it keeps getting bigger &amp; bigger on the backs of devs &amp; artists. @raphkoster made billions for the games he designed, but had to start his own company to be able cash out. <a href="https://twitter.com/David_Mullich/status/1092876262937370625">https://twitter.com/David_Mullich/status/1092876262937370625</a>

  	      Since games are digital assets, which blockchains support very well, there is an opportunity for a fair &amp; transparent AAA game company to transform the industry.

  	      I know that some game companies are experimenting with blockchains, but mostly for ICO &amp; seigniorage revenue, not for transformation of how games are financed, designed &amp; built, and played &amp; supported. I believe it is possible.
