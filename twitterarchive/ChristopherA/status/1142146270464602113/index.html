  	      …NTS is not even officially final yet, but has been through 15 drafts <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ntp-network-time-security-15">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ntp-network-time-security-15</a> Now that @Cloudflare is offering NTS as a free, distributed &amp; reliable service, hopefully more infrastructure providers &amp; OS updates will begin to support it.
