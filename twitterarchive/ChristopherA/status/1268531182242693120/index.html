  	      But we've seen a more likely situation in recent months: COVID-19 lockdowns. Banks have been accessible, but what if you left private keys with friends or family? It would have been illegal to retrieve them. What if they were at a work place and you couldn't go there? (3/9)

  	      The recent riots offer another very real example of a physical DENIAL OF ACCESS. There might have been curfews blocking your access, or it might be unsafe to go and retrieve your cold storage keys. (4/9)

  	      We take our freedom of movement for granted in the first world, and that may well be the case when all of this is done. But our #SmartCustody book anthropomorphizes adversaries so that you can better understand them and better consider the concretely. (5/9)

  	      There are of course other forms of DENIAL OF ACCESS. What if your hardware or processor manufacturer bricks or freezes all of your secure devices? Estonia did this is 2017 due to an security flaw, preventing access to all e-ID services. <a href="https://amp.insider.com/estonia-freeze-e-residency-id-cards-id-theft-2017-11">https://amp.insider.com/estonia-freeze-e-residency-id-cards-id-theft-2017-11</a> (7/9)

  	      One of our top solutions is redundant storage. If you have keys in more than one place, particularly disparate sorts of places, then it's less likely that you'll lose access to all of them. Obviously, any solution may introduce its own adversaries as well. (8/9)

  	      An example of this. I currently have a backup key not in the same county as my primary key, in case of big fires like we saw in recent years in California. But I’m still at risk in case of earthquake, so was considering moving it to Wyoming or EU. But given #COVID19? Not sure.
