  	      This is a situation where someone knows that you have digital assets, knows where those assets are held, and it prepared to physically break in to retrieve them. It's a bit terrifying. (2/8)

  	      It's also somewhat unlikely. And #SmartCustody is all about bloodlessly considering threats and seeing which ones are actually adversaries that you have to face. (3/8)

  	      Is someone likely to break into your house, disguise themself as a service person, or place nearby listening devices? Probably not. But compare it to your profile and vulnerability. How well known is your wealth, how secure is it, and how large is it? (4/8)

  	      This is another situation where the best protection might be anonymity. If no one knows about your cryptocurrency or other digital assets, then no one will make a special effort to steal it. (5/8)

  	      You can take steps to increase your privacy. For instance, see @lopp's article reflecting on privacy after a SWAT incident <a href="https://blog.lopp.net/reflections-upon-a-swatting/">https://blog.lopp.net/reflections-upon-a-swatting/</a> that resulted in his extensive advice at <a href="https://blog.lopp.net/modest-privacy-protection-proposal/">https://blog.lopp.net/modest-privacy-protection-proposal/</a> (6/8)

  	      It is a balancing actâ€”if you try to protect against all possible adversaries at once, you will become paralyzed.  Instead, take a look at each seperately. SOPHISTICATED PHYSICAL THEFT is scary, but unless you are a public figure other adversaries are likely a greater threat.(7/8)
