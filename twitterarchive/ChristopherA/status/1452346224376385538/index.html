  	      @ineiti @SarahJamieLewis I’m not saying that working toward some type of “proof of unique personhood in a group context” isn’t incredibly valuable, but I’m suggesting be humble and realize it will not be easy and you are unlikely to mitigate or even spot all the risks. Most PoP teams don’t seem to yet.

  	      @ineiti @SarahJamieLewis I am, in particular, very concerned about some current global proof of personhood projects, in particular those that require or allow correlation (linkage) to real world identities. When largely 1st-world cis white males are are willing to risk privacy to show status, be scared.
