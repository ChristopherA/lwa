  	      The Wyoming DAO/LAO authorization bill draft is at <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2020/S19-2020121621LSO-0263v0.5.pdf">https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2020/S19-2020121621LSO-0263v0.5.pdf</a>. I am not an attorney, so if you have ideas on how to make sure it allows decision-making/voting by UTXO holders and not just Ethereum contracts, I'd love advice.
