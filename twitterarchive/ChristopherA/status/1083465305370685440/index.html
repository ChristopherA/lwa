  	      One of the challenges today in blockchain &amp; cryptographic security is the “free rider” problem where large organizations benefit hugely from the efforts of a few critical open source cryptographic developers, but do not fully support them. This led to events like #Heartbleed …

  	      I’m exploring how to address these blockchain infrastructure &amp; internet security problems in a vendor-neutral (and blockchain independent) way through something I’m calling #BlockchainCommons. You can support as dev by contributing time, or as vendor w/$. <a href="https://www.BlockchainCommons.com">https://www.BlockchainCommons.com</a>

  	      For instance, former bitcoin-core dev @MarkFriedenbach has committed 50 days a year to #BlockchainCommons, as have I. With more dev time commitments of even just 5-days a year each (say to do a peer review) we can reach out to foundations &amp; corps to support us financially. …

  	      Not all problems are cryptographic — we are also working on better standards for digital asset management &amp; custody as these are becoming huge risk to our ecosystem.
