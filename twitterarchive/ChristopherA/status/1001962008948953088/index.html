  	      Is anyone still working on lowering the costs of doing Reg A+ securities as digital assets? I’m less interested in utility tokens &amp; more on equity tokens that offer better ways to offer better/wiser corporate governance processes. Have ICOs killed Reg A+? <a href="https://www.seedinvest.com/blog/jobs-act/raising-capital-reg-a-mini-ipo">https://www.seedinvest.com/blog/jobs-act/raising-capital-reg-a-mini-ipo</a>

  	      I’m not interested in instant liquidity that ICOs offer — I’d rather help orgs find long-term investors that want to build an ecosystem and all profit through dividends, not investors primarily interested in increase in equity price &amp; exit. Better alignment of interests my way.
