  	      This paper is by @aitherick, and there is nothing wrong with it, but shared language created in the DID/VC community often collide with terms used. And the DID/VC community solution space with its precise data schema &amp; formats  is often at odds with claims about arbitrary data.

  	      How do bridge this when we are not yet done with safe decentralized identity? Needed as many of the people who want to make these more arbitrary verifiable claims (journalist, activists) need that protection? And the rathole of solving reputation rears its ugly head in both.
