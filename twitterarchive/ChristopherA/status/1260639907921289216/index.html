  	      @maxkriegers @kallewoof One of the interesting challenges of being based on DOM architecture, was if a co-editor had a web-based spell checker installed, everyone would see the spell check.  We had to work around that, but that also meant that anything that used DOM UI worked. TiddlyWiki for instance.

  	      @maxkriegers @kallewoof Three of my favorite features in SynchroEdit were in the chat sidebar. It was persistent (google docs are not), ordering was by when you STARTED typing, not when you hit return (made for better chat transcripts), and you can edit, add or annotate old comments with URLs and such.
