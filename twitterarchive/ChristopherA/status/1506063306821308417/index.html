  	      @csuwildcat @Iiterature In a sense this makes our encryption like taproot, privacy first. We also hope to support musig/frost capable Schnorr, which means you can also encrypt or decrypt to groups. But some interesting security challenges ahead, for instance key agreement between two frost groups.
