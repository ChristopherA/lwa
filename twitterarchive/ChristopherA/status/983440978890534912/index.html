  	      Only read site, but PreVeil appears reasonably self-sovereign architecture for file sharing (aka Dropbox). 25519 private keys have social key recovery using Shamir Secret Sharing (biggest weakness I suspect but acceptable) &amp; uses miniLock style envelope. Worthy of investigating. <a href="https://twitter.com/ralucaadapopa/status/983384513853120512">https://twitter.com/ralucaadapopa/status/983384513853120512</a>

  	      My open questions so far: Is PreVeil using JavaScript like miniLock? Or is it using native code? An advantage of iPhone is some 25519-based APIs are available—is it using any? The iPhone app for PreVeil doesn’t seem to use TouchID, where is private key stored? Where on Android?

  	      Right now it appears PreVeil keys are tied to email addresses, which limits their self-sovereignty. However, PreVeil theoretically never has your key (generated on the device) and the key shares should be encrypted to your recovery group. But how do the recover you if lost email?

  	      If PreVeil added some type of public key identifier (FYI my miniLock public EdDSA key using the 25519 curve  is 7rXYBKi1Xf9g9nupb9f8u6MHbobEJCMK3r3sChjN5RmGN) so I could migrate past my registered email, could easily be a new DID method. @ralucaadapopa <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io">https://w3c-ccg.github.io</a>

  	      With miniLock the parties for whom may be able to decrypt your file is opaque—no one can see who but you. But I suspect PreVeil know who your recovery key partners are &amp; what email belongs to users can decrypt a file. Just rubber-hose one decryptor or M of N of recovery partners.
