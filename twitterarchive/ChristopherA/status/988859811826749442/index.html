  	      I wonder if there are tech companies that would release their devs to participate in a secondment (def: <a href="https://www.wikijob.co.uk/content/internships/advice/what-secondment">https://www.wikijob.co.uk/content/internships/advice/what-secondment</a>) to do blockchain commons &amp; open source alongside major blockchain devs, a few weeks to 50 days a year to work on open source? …

  	      These secondment practices are like externships but for experienced staff. They exist in other industries. Top chef’s do them, calling them `stages’ (pronounced w/French accent `staaj’). Lawyers do them. They help share best practices, cross-fertilize ideas &amp; train new skills.

  	      These secondments don’t have to be pure volunteer work—I’m discussing the idea with a few high net-worth patrons, well-funded tech startups, and hedge funds that all want to financially support open source #BlockchainCommons security, infrastructure &amp; standards.

  	      There are a number of technology projects that our ecosystem needs, but there are not business models for them when they are openly shared like they need to be, and purely volunteer models have a difficult time supporting them long term. A #BlockchainCommons could address this.

  	      Part of what I’m puzzling out with #BlockchainCommons is how to support long-term. As co-author TLS events like HeartBleed happen due to tragedy of the commons. “A flaw in the human character is that everybody wants to build and nobody wants to do maintenance.”—@Kurt_Vonnegut
