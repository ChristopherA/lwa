  	      üëèüëç‚ÄúGoogle announced SkyWater PDK, the first manufacturable, open source process design kit. What differentiates this PDK‚Ä¶is the fact that it is manufacturable: with this PDK, you can actually produce chips with the SkyWater foundry in the 130nm node.‚Äù <a href="https://fossi-foundation.org/2020/06/30/skywater-pdk">https://fossi-foundation.org/2020/06/30/skywater-pdk</a>

  	      I‚Äôd love to se a good TRNG, ability to securely store 8 private master keys, ability to pass in derivative paths, and sign using the resulting keys securely with secp256k1 in both ECDSA &amp; Schnorr, able to accept provable nonce mix, and 8 monotonic counters. All auditable.
