  	      “The solution, to me anyway, seems almost too easy. Students should have two long classes each day for six to eight weeks. They should come to school in the morning and intensely study a single subject…When the term ends, they move on to another subject.” <a href="https://medium.com/s/story/the-insane-structure-of-high-school-762fea58fe62">https://medium.com/s/story/the-insane-structure-of-high-school-762fea58fe62</a>

  	      When I was teaching for an MBA for Sustainable Systems program, I was part of team that designed a new first year. Instead 30 credit hours of typically 3 credit hour courses, it was a carefully designed sequence of a 9 credit hour course for three quarters, plus hour of coaching.
