  	      What does activism have to do with Blockchain Commons? We've been building blockchain architectures focused on anonymity, privacy, and non-correlation. But this isn't just about keeping your bitcoins safe: we're working to protect people, not just money.

  	      Red Cross workers are having their computers seized or searched while crossing borers; whistleblowers are being sought out for deanonymization, identification, and punishment; and journalists are facing new hostility. They all need ways to keep their work private. [5/10]

  	      Of course, our architecture is only helpful if it's accessible to the people who need it. That's where we hope to get support from our Summer 2021 interns. Gordian expansions, activist documentation, and Tails OS bundles are some of the possibilities. [7/10]

  	      But to really support activists requires knowing what they need. So, we're also considering using research and interviews to create user engagement models for activists. This would be similar to the Amira model I worked on for RWOT. [8/10] <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/amira/">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/amira/</a>

  	      We had great results from our 2020 interns, including the creation of Spotbit, extending the anonymity and non-correlation of Bitcoin to pricing services, filling a notable gap. We look forward to this year's output, and thank @HRF for their support in making it possible. [9/10]

  	      Of course, we'd also love to improve the program! You can help by joining HRF in their support, either as a GitHub sponsor (<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons</a>) or with a one-time BTC payment (<a href="https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/">https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/</a>).
