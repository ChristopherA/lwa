  	      @brynosaurus @RuffTimo One of the DIF methods, Sovrin, even goes so far as to have one uncorrelatable identifier for every pair of relationships. The two parties can use these to bootstrap into off-chain claims that use CL Sig (Camenisch Lysyanskaya) blinded attributes <a href="https://misterwip.uk/cl-signatures">https://misterwip.uk/cl-signatures</a>

  	      @brynosaurus @RuffTimo Different DID methods serve different needs. I’m leading BTCR which in spirit is to replace the one place PGP succeeded, which is code signing by pseudoanonymous entities. In our use case we need correlation to allow for reputation to be built, but allow for key rotation.

  	      @brynosaurus @RuffTimo In BTCR all claims are off-chain, but can be timesamped in a hash tree. We don’t offer CL Sig selective disclosure attributes as we don’t need them. We desire to make it difficult to have a universal map of web-of-trust networks, but pseudoanonymous identiFIERS are cheap.

  	      @brynosaurus @RuffTimo Several different DID methods desire to support some form of “proof-of-unique personhood” to allow a variety of intentional association governance. You have some particular expertise in this are we would like to implement in POC potentially THIS year.

  	      @brynosaurus @RuffTimo Yes, there are a number of people on the edge of the community that are making “blockchain identity” claims or are supporting bad practices that I would not endorse. But best way to fix is make standards that solve those problems &amp; encourage market to adopt better practices.

  	      @brynosaurus @RuffTimo The best place to address these problems is to incubate them at the collaborative environment of a #RebootingWebOfTrust design workshop, then bring them forward to W3C &amp; IETF with working code for review and consensus. #RWOT has proven we can do this. <a href="https://rwot8.eventbrite.com">https://rwot8.eventbrite.com</a>
