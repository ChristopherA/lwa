  	      Like the category Acts of God, this is another pretty faceless category. Computer Error is just an Act of God affecting the electronic world instead of the physical world. But unlike it we often can point to people causing errors rather than from an uncontrollable force. (2/7)

  	      Like many of us, I imagine Computer Error as smoke billowing up from a computer whose lights have just blinked out forever. It's a terrifying image. (3/7)

  	      But, there are actually lots of ways that computers can eat up your cryptocurrency and other digital assets. Time and neglect may actually be the enemies most likely to turn your computers against you. (4/7)

  	      I include two specific adversaries in this category: BITROT and SYSTEMIC KEY COMPROMISE. That's your computer becoming unusable; and your keys proving insecure. I'll explain them more in the next few days. (5/7)

  	      And though I talk about how terrifing LOSS BY COMPUTER ERROR is, remember that the goal of anthropomorphizing threats is always to look at them more bloodlessly. Consider these adversaries and ask, "Is this likely to happen to me?" (6/7)
