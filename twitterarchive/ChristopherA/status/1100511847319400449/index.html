  	      @CryptoPietje @matt_odell @philchen913 @htcexodus I was head of Blackphone’s developer relations &amp; dedicated secure Android Apps Store. Blackphone died due to demands from users for enterprise management which Google required adding Google Play Store. Also even with $130M+ capital &amp; credit made them small fry. HTC has a chance.
