  	      A year ago my Kickstarter for a social storytelling cooperative card game "Gate Watch" was a success. I'd thought that I'd do a number of other small projects over the next few years.

  	      For a cooperative storytelling game, Zoom + Screen Sharing isn't that bad as in general these games all information is public. The problem is that TOO much information is public — it overwhelm's the players. …

  	      So far, the key thing appears to be having up front a clear shared signal of what conversational modality are we in. Are we in information sharing? Brainstorming? Are we trying to make a decision? Are we trying to document to share with others? …

  	      What other types of problems might be solved with some type of screen-shared worksheet? Have you created anything like this in Google Docs, Google sheets, or other shared document environment? Do you have tricks doing screen sharing of a facilitative document? Let me know!
