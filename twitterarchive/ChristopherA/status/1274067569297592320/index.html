  	      This is one of the many adversaries that I talk about in #SmartCustody: threats to your digital assets that I anthropomorphize to help you assess how dangerous they are to you (or not). Then help you balance those actual threats vs. the cost to mitigate them. (2/12)

  	      These tricks need not be very technical. My colleague got an email from a partner in China with a new email. That partner also received a new email. The attacker just sat in the middle, carefully forwarding each email until the right moment and changed the crucial address. (6/12)

  	      Social engineering can be devastatingly clever. The bottom line is that you should never type in your credentials unless you went to a site in a way that confirmed it's the real thing or you saw its certificate. (7/12)

  	      Learning to use two-factor authentication (2FA) is also a requirement: it ensures that if someone else gets your credentials, they still can't get into a site (unless they port your cell phone number, but at least that's an additional obstacle). (8/12)
