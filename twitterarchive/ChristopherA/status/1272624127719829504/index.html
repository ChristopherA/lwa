  	      WiFi offers one of the prime vectors for this attack. If you connect to a free WiFi, someone might be spoofing the sites you're connecting to and collecting your credentials. (2/7)

  	      A user of Coinbase encountered a different sort of attack. After he invested in cryptocurrency, hackers broke into his T-Mobile account, used that to access Google's 2FA, and used that to get into the Coinbase account.

  	      This is one of the adversaries where you have the greatest personal agency in defeating it. It's all about having great internet security: protecting your passwords, protecting your phone, and otherwise making sure that hackers can't get to your credentials. (4/7)

  	      Of course the alternative is just to hide the fact that you have cryptocurrency at all. Don't tell people about it, don't access it except from the safety of your home network. Security by Obscurity usually fails, but here you're just not giving hackers a target. (5/7)

  	      But you need to remain vigilant because this is a situation where the result is likely to be total loss: if hackers know you have cryptocurrency, and they attack you to get it, they're going to take it all! (6/7)
